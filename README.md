# my-first-repo
My name is Myles and I currently reside in the Marcy Lab School curriculum. 
I've been using computers since I was 6 and I've always dreamed of having a job in the computer industry.
I currently live with my family in Bed Stuy in a house of 4 and hope to get a job as a programmer at Riot Games.
I love to draw, cook, play video games, and enjoy time with people close to me.
